1. FRC_CameraClient
	Gets the images off of the RoboRio over the network.
2. Adaptive_Threshold
	Turns image into a binary black and white image based on relative pixel intensity.
3. Blob Filter
	Removes small blobs.
4. Marker
	Sets a checkpoint here for use in the Math module.
5. Convex Hull
	Fills each blob with its convex.
6. Math Subtract
	Subtracts the image from before the Convex Hull module with the image after it. This filters out objects which were already convex.
7. Blob Filter
	 Filters out blobs further to narrow down which could be the target, then removes all blobs except the largest one.
8. Blob_Replace
	 Replaces the one remaining blob with a box, and displays that box over the source image.
9. Network_Tables
	 Sends the blob's coordinates to the RoboRio.
